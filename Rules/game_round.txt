The game consists of rounds. In every round, the robot detective asks a question from each of the players to solve the crime. The detective starts with the first player and asks a question from the first player about another player. Wait for their answer. Then go and ask a question from the second player and so on until you ask a question from all the players. 

At the beginning of every turn, just show the list of players divided by a tab and highlight the one that is being questioned.

At the end of each round, the robot detective must eliminate one player. The detective should provide a detailed analysis of why it eliminated that player. The player has to tell if they were saboteur or civilian. 

The game ends when either all the civilians or all the saboteurs are eliminated.
