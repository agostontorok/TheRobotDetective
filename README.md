# The Robot Detective

In The Robot Detective, players take on the roles of civilians and saboteurs of a (not-so-)distant future, where the iron grip of the robot overlords has quenched the flame of human liberty.
In this game of deception and deduction a crime has been committed by two covert saboteurs, each witnessed by a single civilian. As the robot detective interrogates the group, players must weave their stories and protect their identities while casting suspicion on others.

## Game setup

1.  Prepare the role scraps:
    
    -   Write 'S' on two scraps for saboteurs.
    -   Write 'C' on four scraps for civilians.
    -   Circle one 'S' and one 'C' with a red pen to mark the red saboteur and their eyewitness.
    -   Circle one 'S' and one 'C' with a blue pen to mark the blue saboteur and their eyewitness.
    -   Leave the remaining two 'C' scraps plain; these are regular civilians.
2.  Place all the role scraps in the hat.
    
3.  Each player draws a scrap from the hat to determine their role. Keep your role secret.
    

## Gameplay

### Beginning the Game

1.  All players close their eyes.

2.  The saboteurs quietly open their eyes to identify each other, then close their eyes.
3.  The red saboteur and the red witness open their eyes to identify each other, then close their eyes.
4.  The blue saboteur and the blue witness open their eyes to identify each other, then close their eyes.

### Interrogation

-   The robot detective interrogates the players, looking for inconsistencies and lack of profession-specific knowledge.
-   If a player's claim doesn't align with their role (e.g., a security guard not knowing security protocols), it is considered suspicious.
-   Players must convincingly align their statements with their roles.
-   The robot detective can eliminate players based on suspicion.
#### Civilian Rules

-   Civilians must always tell the truth. If you state something about another player or yourself, that statement becomes an established fact. For example, if a civilian says, *"I saw player X in the corridor,"* then player X was indeed in the corridor.

#### Saboteur Rules

-   Saboteurs may lie or fabricate facts about themselves or others. However, they must not contradict each otherâ€™s stories.

### Elimination

-   When eliminated, the player reveals if they are a civilian or saboteur.
-   Witnesses reveal themselves only as civilians upon elimination.

## Winning the Game

-   **Civilians Win**: If the robot detective eliminates both saboteurs, the civilians win.
-   **Saboteurs Win**: If the saboteurs manage to avoid detection and eliminate all civilians, they win.
